The forecasting challenge is similar to a data science challenge or model-intercomparison project except that this is a true forecast  the validation data hasnE28099t been collected yet at the time predictions are made.Individuals or team contacts can register to submit forecasts HERE <https://nd.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_9MJ29y2xNrBOjqZ> and registration includes categories for different career stages. There are five themes in the Challenge that span a broad range of terrestrial and aquatic systems across the United States.Challenges Themes:Aquatic Ecosystems - Once-a-month forecasts of dissolved oxygen and water temperature from a NEON lake and a river site. Forecasts have a daily time step for 7 days into the future and forecast submissions are accepted May 31-August 31, 2021Terrestrial Carbon and Water Fluxes - Once-a-month forecasts of net ecosystem exchange of CO2, evapotranspiration, and soil moisture at four terrestrial NEON sites that differ in water availability. Forecasts should have a half hour or daily timestep for 35 days into the future and forecast submissions are accepted January 31-December 31, 2021Beetle Communities - Once-a-month forecasts of beetle abundance and species richness forecasts at 47 terrestrial NEON sites. Forecasts should have a weekly timestep for 20 months in the future and forecasts submissions are accepted June 30-December 31, 2021Tick Abundance - Once-a-month forecasts of Amblyomma americanum and Ixodes scapularis nymphal tick abundance at seven NEON sites. Forecasts should have a weekly timestep for 34 weeks into the future and forecast submissions are accepted March 31-October 31, 2021Phenology - Daily forecasts of plant greenness at seven deciduous broadleaf forest NEON sites as measured by Phenocams. Forecasts should have a daily timestep for 35 days into the future and forecast submission are accepted February 1-July 1, 2021 (spring) with a second round being run for the autumn.Forecasts may be submitted after the start date for each theme. Evaluations will occur throughout the year and are intended to result in a journal special issue highlighting the different approaches and lessons learned.The design of the challenge is the result of contributions of over 200 participants in the May 2020 virtual EFI-RCN meeting, including partner organizations, and the hard work from the Design Teams that have developed the protocols for each of the themes.20The primary goals of this challenge are to improve our predictive capacity for these five research areas, all of which have both scientific and societal value, to advance the discipline of ecological forecasting, and to build community. Across these five forecast areas we are excited to learn more about the patterns of predictability of different ecological processes and what modeling frameworks, mechanistic processes, and statistical approaches best capture community, population, and ecosystem dynamics.  We aim to support a collegial, supportive environment focused on friendly competition and encourage participation across a range of disciplines (hydrologists, epidemiologists, data scientists, statisticians, computer scientists, etc.) not ecologists.With this launch, we are sharing an overview of the themes, how to participate and forecast evaluation descriptions on our Challenge webpage <https://ecoforecast.org/efi-rcn-forecast-challenges/> to help individuals, lab groups, and course instructors think about participating in this first round of the EFI NEON Ecological Forecast Challenge. Indeed, a number of courses are participating in the challenge this spring and fall and weE28099d encourage you to contact us eco4cast.initiative@gmail.com <mailto:eco4cast.initiative@gmail.com> if youE28099d like to participate as a class.We will provide additional information about the Challenge on the Challenge webpage <https://ecoforecast.org/efi-rcn-forecast-challenges/>, and at the December 9, AGU EFI Town Hall <https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm20/meetingapp.cgi/Session/102792>. There are Slack channels and GitHub repositories for each theme where registered participants can discuss issues and shared challenges. These repositories will include a E2809CnullE2809D forecast workflow for each challenge that teams can build off of to develop more interesting forecasts.20"

This project combines synoptic spatial sampling of DOC concentration and characterization with high-frequency sensors at different spatial scales (headwaters to large rivers). We will assess how differences in urban development patterns and climate among U.S. cities affect spatial and temporal scales of variability and controls on DOC characteristics, processing, and export from urban network watersheds. Study watersheds are located in Boston (MA), Atlanta (GA), Miami (FL), Salt Lake City (UT), and Portland (OR). We envision rotating positions, such that each postdoc will split their three years between universities within or near the focal cities of their choosing (1.5 years in each), working with PI Rebecca Hale (Idaho State University) and two other PIs. PI and university affiliations      include: Miami (PI: John Kominoski at Florida International University), Atlanta (PI: Krista Capps at University of Georgia), Boston (PI: Allison Roy at University of Massachusetts) and Portland (PI: Jennifer Morse at Portland State University). Rotating between sites will give the postdocs a wide range of experiences and facilitate close collaborations with all PIs. In addition to leading individual site research and developing associated manuscripts, one postdoc will lead cross-city synthesis papers focused on synoptic sampling efforts and spatial patterns of DOC, including DOC concentrations, PARAFAC modeling for DOC characterization, bioavailability, and extracellular enzyme activity. We envision the second postdoc leading cross-site synthesis papers focused on high-frequency DOC sensor datasets, which will address variation in temporal patterns and drivers of DOC.
