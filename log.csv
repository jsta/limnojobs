The forecasting challenge is similar to a data science challenge or model-intercomparison project except that this is a true forecast  the validation data hasnE28099t been collected yet at the time predictions are made.Individuals or team contacts can register to submit forecasts HERE <https://nd.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_9MJ29y2xNrBOjqZ> and registration includes categories for different career stages. There are five themes in the Challenge that span a broad range of terrestrial and aquatic systems across the United States.Challenges Themes:Aquatic Ecosystems - Once-a-month forecasts of dissolved oxygen and water temperature from a NEON lake and a river site. Forecasts have a daily time step for 7 days into the future and forecast submissions are accepted May 31-August 31, 2021Terrestrial Carbon and Water Fluxes - Once-a-month forecasts of net ecosystem exchange of CO2, evapotranspiration, and soil moisture at four terrestrial NEON sites that differ in water availability. Forecasts should have a half hour or daily timestep for 35 days into the future and forecast submissions are accepted January 31-December 31, 2021Beetle Communities - Once-a-month forecasts of beetle abundance and species richness forecasts at 47 terrestrial NEON sites. Forecasts should have a weekly timestep for 20 months in the future and forecasts submissions are accepted June 30-December 31, 2021Tick Abundance - Once-a-month forecasts of Amblyomma americanum and Ixodes scapularis nymphal tick abundance at seven NEON sites. Forecasts should have a weekly timestep for 34 weeks into the future and forecast submissions are accepted March 31-October 31, 2021Phenology - Daily forecasts of plant greenness at seven deciduous broadleaf forest NEON sites as measured by Phenocams. Forecasts should have a daily timestep for 35 days into the future and forecast submission are accepted February 1-July 1, 2021 (spring) with a second round being run for the autumn.Forecasts may be submitted after the start date for each theme. Evaluations will occur throughout the year and are intended to result in a journal special issue highlighting the different approaches and lessons learned.The design of the challenge is the result of contributions of over 200 participants in the May 2020 virtual EFI-RCN meeting, including partner organizations, and the hard work from the Design Teams that have developed the protocols for each of the themes.20The primary goals of this challenge are to improve our predictive capacity for these five research areas, all of which have both scientific and societal value, to advance the discipline of ecological forecasting, and to build community. Across these five forecast areas we are excited to learn more about the patterns of predictability of different ecological processes and what modeling frameworks, mechanistic processes, and statistical approaches best capture community, population, and ecosystem dynamics.  We aim to support a collegial, supportive environment focused on friendly competition and encourage participation across a range of disciplines (hydrologists, epidemiologists, data scientists, statisticians, computer scientists, etc.) not ecologists.With this launch, we are sharing an overview of the themes, how to participate and forecast evaluation descriptions on our Challenge webpage <https://ecoforecast.org/efi-rcn-forecast-challenges/> to help individuals, lab groups, and course instructors think about participating in this first round of the EFI NEON Ecological Forecast Challenge. Indeed, a number of courses are participating in the challenge this spring and fall and weE28099d encourage you to contact us eco4cast.initiative@gmail.com <mailto:eco4cast.initiative@gmail.com> if youE28099d like to participate as a class.We will provide additional information about the Challenge on the Challenge webpage <https://ecoforecast.org/efi-rcn-forecast-challenges/>, and at the December 9, AGU EFI Town Hall <https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm20/meetingapp.cgi/Session/102792>. There are Slack channels and GitHub repositories for each theme where registered participants can discuss issues and shared challenges. These repositories will include a E2809CnullE2809D forecast workflow for each challenge that teams can build off of to develop more interesting forecasts.20"

This project combines synoptic spatial sampling of DOC concentration and characterization with high-frequency sensors at different spatial scales (headwaters to large rivers). We will assess how differences in urban development patterns and climate among U.S. cities affect spatial and temporal scales of variability and controls on DOC characteristics, processing, and export from urban network watersheds. Study watersheds are located in Boston (MA), Atlanta (GA), Miami (FL), Salt Lake City (UT), and Portland (OR). We envision rotating positions, such that each postdoc will split their three years between universities within or near the focal cities of their choosing (1.5 years in each), working with PI Rebecca Hale (Idaho State University) and two other PIs. PI and university affiliations      include: Miami (PI: John Kominoski at Florida International University), Atlanta (PI: Krista Capps at University of Georgia), Boston (PI: Allison Roy at University of Massachusetts) and Portland (PI: Jennifer Morse at Portland State University). Rotating between sites will give the postdocs a wide range of experiences and facilitate close collaborations with all PIs. In addition to leading individual site research and developing associated manuscripts, one postdoc will lead cross-city synthesis papers focused on synoptic sampling efforts and spatial patterns of DOC, including DOC concentrations, PARAFAC modeling for DOC characterization, bioavailability, and extracellular enzyme activity. We envision the second postdoc leading cross-site synthesis papers focused on high-frequency DOC sensor datasets, which will address variation in temporal patterns and drivers of DOC.

ESA Career Center,2020-11-26,i,U.S. Forest Service (USFS)- ORISE: Soil Science Postdoctoral Fellowship | https://www.esacareercenter.org/job-details/2268/soil-science-postdoctoral-fellowship/?utm_source=DirectRSS&utm_medium=direct | ESA Career Center,"A postdoctoral research opportunity is currently available with the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), U.S. Forest Service (USFS), Office of Sustainability and Climate. The opportunity location is negotiable depending on candidate selection and COVID-19 protocols. Climate change is already changing precipitation regimes in ways that are increasing both flooding and drought events. Soil moisture is a critical pool linking the hydrologic response to changing precipitation. However, knowledge and monitoring of the spatial and temporal variation of soil moisture is currently lacking, especially for forested lands. The selected participant will gain applied science skills from multidisciplinary research and land management programs coordinated by the Office of Sustainability and Climate, which supports national forests and grasslands with the tools, training, and resources needed to build resiliency into public lands in the face of a changing climate. The fellow will participate in a USDA interagency effort to model soil moisture spatial and temporal variability in two long-term research forested gaged catchments—Coweeta Hydrologic Lab, North Carolina and Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest, New Hampshire and apply this to the Natural Resource Conservation Service (NRCS) efforts to develop a new dynamic soil survey product. These data will ultimately be used to support modeling efforts to predict soil moisture and report dynamic soil properties at a landscape scale in near real-time and at multiple spatial scales. This is a cooperative project that brings together soil moisture and hydrologic modeling across two agencies, NRCS and the Forest Service. Currently parameters describing forest soils in NRCS soil surveys are static (e.g. hydraulic conductivity, soil carbon, water holding capacity); however, these are known to be dynamic on various spatial and temporal scales. The fellow will gain experience by building spatially explicit models of soil moisture dynamics at watershed scales in two (or more) Forest Service Experimental Forests, including the Coweeta Hydrologic Lab and Hubbard Brook. These models will incorporate long-term hydrometeorologic data and both NRCS and locally developed soil surveys to examine sensitivity in predictions of spatial and temporal dynamics in soil moisture. These modeling efforts will inform expanded data collection through a soil moisture monitoring network and inform efforts to implement soil moisture modeling across all federal forest lands. This research is critical for guiding land management options for forest drought responses and mitigation. The fellow will also gain project management experience by assisting with evaluation of existing precipitation, soil moisture and streamflow data, as well as soil property data to identify data gaps which may need to be filled to advance overall project goals. The fellow will gain communication and coordination experience by facilitating the transfer of data and information across agency boundaries (USDA Forest Service (FS) and Natural Resource Conservation Service (NRCS). Under the guidance of a mentor, the participant will gain experience through hands-on learning in the following activities: Creating a project design with a definition of project area, expected data products, sharing platform and expected results (acceptable techniques) for soil moisture modeling and product development. Using data to parameterize, validate, and verify a spatially explicit dynamic hydrologic model to predict variation in soil moisture across the watersheds. Identification of data gaps, critical locations and times for data collection, and strategies for the deployment of additional sensors and stations to collect data at both watershed sites. Presenting results and recommendations at scientific conferences and to agency principals. Modeling various scenarios, such as using static vs. dynamic soil properties in model runs, using dynamic soil survey products/digital soil mapping/high resolution soil property maps, and current vs. future climate regimes to inform design of a dynamic raster-based soil survey. Coordinating and developing a collaborative approach to working across different agency boundaries and effectively communicating to partners to enhance understanding and ensure success.

We especially encourage applications from candidates whose scholarship bridges the research interests across the sections of our department, namely Human and Evolutionary Biology, Marine and Environmental Biology, Molecular and Computational Biology, and Neurobiology.""  Multiple positions available. Dornsife=main campus. 2) You have to start the application to get info on letters, statements etc.: Please upload in a single pdf file, a curriculum vita, a cover letter, and research, teaching, and diversity-equity-inclusion statements.; and 4 letters of rec are required.  3) Based on my reading of this and the other diversity hires on campus, I thought the 4th letter could be directly addressing outreach and inclusion.  I got one from a nonprofit that I work with.  Hoping I didn't mess that up. 4) I've never been in a search committee, but a 4th letter coming from a purely DEI referrer sounds very good to me, particularly if your other 3 are chiefly academic. 5) @4 ""purely DEI"" and academia doesn't/shouldn't be seperate. That's the problem with academia. 6) (4 again) @5 I don't mean to start a war here (mainly because I think we see this the same way), but what you suggest is not at all what I meant. I was replying to #3's indication that their fourth letter would be from a non-profit, i.e. I assume a ""chiefly"" non-academic institution. In contrast to that, I assumed we could safely call the other three letters ""chiefly academic"" (I did not write ""purely""), meaning ""chiefly"" addressing research since that's what the referrers would be in a position to discuss regarding #3, for whatever reason.   3 again) My DEI/Outreach letter was asked to focus almost entirely on outreach. They can say how great I am, but they don't work in CompBio so they don't have the right credentials to critique research or its place in the field the way that my academic advisors could.  My advisors also cannot advocate for the full impacts of my outreach in the same way that the nonprofit can.  Academic research and service have to be linked, but the perspectives are very different. 7) (4&6 again) Yep, that was the assumption I had made in my comments. Thanks for clarifying, @3, and apologies if what I wrote came across as suggesting that academia and DEI efforts should be separate – I think we can all agree that they should not. 3) Hi 4&6, I also thought it was important to make that distinction in light of the comments from 5.  There should be a link, but complementary expertise will have its own perspective  8) References were requested-- I can't remember which jobs at USC made it clear that they were requesting up front or after a first cut. For this one they requested the letters already. 9) I also received the reference request (11/16). They only asked for the contact information, but asking the letters before the review date. Baiting.. 10) Does anybody know why there is a separate search for Quantitative/Computational Biology? Aren't they all part of the same department?"

However, such actions may differ in their effects, e.g. because they promote different aspects of biodiversity, and benefits may depend on landscape structure. We will develop ecological models able to predict the effect of agricultural land-use and management on different biodiversity components and regulating ecosystem services, and validate those using existing data. In collaboration with additional expertise, the models will be linked to an ecological-economic framework to be able to evaluate effects of alternative agricultural policies.  We are looking for a candidate with a PhD in ecology, environmental science, mathematics or similar, with documented skills in quantitative ecological modelling. The candidate should have demonstrated skills in scientific publishing, be fluent in spoken and written English, and be able to work both independently and as part of a team.

Much of the western U.S. relies on forested, high-elevation watersheds for water supply, in addition to protection from flash flooding. These forested watersheds are vulnerable to wildfire, which can substantially increase the post-wildfire flood risk to the built environment, including water supply infrastructure, and lead to changes in the quality and quantity of water supplies. Wildfire effects can also change streamflow quantity and timing though impacts on snow processes, interception, transpiration, and infiltration. After wildfires, increased surface runoff during storms can entrain surface contaminants and carry them to streams, lakes, and reservoirs. These problems lead to decreased water availability, higher water treatment costs, and impairment to aquatic ecosystems. Better understanding of the impacts of wildfire on water quality will increase the accuracy and timeliness of guidance about water availability, water quality, and water-related hazards, and will be used by water providers and land managers to mitigate post-wildfire threats to the Nation’s water security.

[ECOLOG],2021-01-16,i,PhD in Ecology - Impact of forest harvesting on the functioning and health of lakes | https://www.uqat.ca/en/ | [ECOLOG],"\r\n\r\nContext and problematic: The boreal forest is the largest forest biome in the world. It is characterized by large areas of land covered by trees in constant interaction with diverse aquatic environments. These aquatic habitats, such as boreal lakes, are therefore largely dependent on the boreal forest for their functioning. Consequently, anthropic disturbances such as forest harvesting can strongly influence the functioning and health of these lakes, especially by causing an additional supply of nutrients and organic matter. However, the consequences of forest harvesting on the functioning and resilience of aquatic food webs are still largely unknown. For example, these new additions can either promote biological growth via nutrients or decrease it due to reduced light penetration into the water. In addition, total cutting, which is the silvicultural method with the greatest potential impact on aquatic ecosystems, is the most widely used in Quebec and Canada. To achieve sustainable forest ecosystem management, it will therefore be important in the future to account for the impact of forest harvesting on the structure, functioning and health of aquatic ecosystems.\r\n\r\nProject description: The objective of this PhD project is to determine the impact of forest harvesting on the functioning and health of lake ecosystems in the boreal forest. Several lakes in northern Abitibi will be sampled before and after logging to assess the consequences on the lake physico-chemistry and on the structure, functioning and health of the aquatic food webs. The entire food web will be studied, from bacteria to fish, phytoplankton, zooplankton and macroinvertebrates, using techniques such as stable isotopes and fatty acids.\r\n \r\nLocation: The student will be based at the Forest Research Institute (IRF) on the campus of the Universit\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9 du Qu\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9bec en Abitibi-T\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9miscamingue (UQAT, https://www.uqat.ca/en/) in Amos. The IRF is a team of researchers with expertise in the study of the boreal forest that is unique in Canada. The Amos campus offers a quality environment to students, close to nature, offering many cultural activities and a high quality of life thanks to its numerous outdoor activities. Our research team is young, dynamic and multicultural. Although UQAT is a French-speaking university, we know the importance of a bilingual environment to succeed in research and any student who can express himself/herself in English is welcome in our program. The student will be a member of the Groupe of Ecology Research in Abitibi (GREMA), the Chair in Sustainable Forest Management (http://chaireafd.uqat.ca/) and of strategic groups of excellence in Canada: the Interuniversity Group in Limnology (https://oraprdnt.uqtr.uquebec.ca/pls/public/gscw031?owa_no_site843&owa_no_fiche91) and the Centre for Forest Research (http://www.cef-cfr.ca/index.php?nActualit%e9.Accueil?userlangen). The student will work closely with our partners (MRC-Abitibi, forestry companies, Quebec ministry). The campus is equipped with all the equipment necessary for the success of the project (zodiac, multi-parameter probe, spectro-fluorometer, microscopes, nets). The project will include a significant portion of remote field work to sample lakes in the middle of the Abitibi boreal forest, as well as laboratory analyses and scientific paper writing. The student will also make an international internship with our collaborators in Sweden.\r\n\r\nFunding: Grant of $21,000 per year for 3 years\r\n\r\nApplication deadline: Feb, 10th 2021\r\n\r\nStarting Date: Spring 2021\r\n\r\nSupervision: Miguel Montoro Girona (https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Miguel_Montoro_Girona) and Guillaume Grosbois (https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Guillaume_Grosbois)\r\n\r\nProfile: \r\n- Education: Master\'s degree (or equivalent) in ecology, biology or environmental sciences with a particular interest in aquatic environments and/or the forest ecosystem.\r\n- Requirement: Be motivated and determined to contribute to the improvement of ecosystem management and preservation.

Hope they maybe want to change this? 5) Yeah @4, this looks really marine-focused. No terrestrial ecologists at all from what I can see. 6) Well the majority of jobs on the board this year are terrestrial. There's been almost nothing for marine! 7) Straight up @6 - the ocean covers more of the planet, damnit! x4 8) Would a marine-focused department be interested in a terrestrial ecologist? 9) @5 here again -- I wasn't complaining, I was just providing context that might be of use to folks in deciding whether to apply. 10) Im a marine invert person who did a PhD w/ majority terrestrial vertebrate co-hort & profs and learned SO MUCH thinking about evolution on land vs ocean.

To date, large-scale water-supply management decisions in the Colorado River basin have not considered the implications for river ecosystems or the recovery of federally listed fish species. In part, failure to consider these ecological implications is because scientists have not synthesized their assessment of the implications of significant changes in flow regime, river temperature, and other ecosystem drivers caused by changes in how much water is stored and released from the large reservoirs of the Colorado River basin. We have begun such a synthesis and seek a highly motivated post-doctoral scientist to continue efforts to quantitatively link physical drivers and fish populations, identify uncertainties, and develop predictive models to support decision makers. For more background on the project see https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/eap.2279 and https://qcnr.usu.edu/coloradoriver/futures. The post-doctoral researcher will work primarily with researchers at Utah State University in Logan, Utah and the US Geological Survey in Flagstaff, Arizona, but also interact with various experts working in the region for state, federal, academic and tribal organizations. The successful candidate will have good interpersonal, organizational and communication skills and experience in either population modelling, structured decision making or related fields.

Doesn't look like there's any contact information with the job posting... 4) @3, #2 here. Like many ads, we don't post a specific person's email to contact, but I am happy to answer any questions right here. 5) #3 again — thank you @2! I'm wondering if you could speak more specifically than the posting about what the search committee is looking for: I see a clear desire for someone who can teach GIS, and some other broad catigories for teaching, but if there are specific classes that the committee is hoping the successful candidate can teach, that would be really helpful to know. Similarly, I'm curious if there are research subjects that are preferred (I do fungal ecology, working on plant-fungal interactions with a conservation ecology bent). Lastly, given the strong conservation bent to my research and outreach activities, I'm curious if the college’s environmental studies program is interested in conservation-oriented courses. 6) There is a Fungus amongus!  @ #3/5 I have the same exact set of questions. How imperative is GIS? @2? 7)@3 @6, #2 here. We aren’t looking for specific classes, per se, but if an applicant purposes class that are not under the broad eco/evo umbrella, they won’t get far. GIS is a plus (not a deal breaker), Our GIS is going on sebbatical. Bennington is a unique school. Its faculty have a lot of freedom in their course offerings. Courses tend to be integrative and highly experiential/student-centered. Students get an education that mirrors a graduate program in many respects. Bennington is small. We have a cell/molec person and an integrative organismal person; we need someone to fill the eco/evo niche, the specifics of that niche are up to the applicants. Conservation? Fungus-plant interactions? That sounds interesting; apply and tell us more. 8) at what point in the search process will references be contacted? 9) @8, #2 here, TBD, but not before the close of the application period. @all, we intend to advertise for a permanant eco/evo faculty member to start Fall 2023. The candidate that fills this role will be in a unique position to apply for the permanant job. 10) @2 thanks for all this helpful information! 11) Echoing the sentiments of @10, it's refreshing to see open communication from a search committee. I see that exising eco-evo classes are terrestrial-focused and the job ad mentions plant science; would aquatic folks be considered equally or is there a true preference toward terrestrial ecologists? 12) @11, #2 here. We welcome all types to apply. There is no preference for terrestrial folks. I definantly encourge aquatic-focused ecologists to apply. "

<b>Details:</b><br/>
Extensive headwater stream and interacting riparian networks play an integral part in maintaining clean and plentiful water for aquatic ecosystems and human beneficial uses. Yet modeling non-perennial streamflow throughout the network is difficult, as variable factors including precipitation, physiography and contributing area change in time and space. Concurrently, stream gauge data to calibrate and verify model response for non-perennial headwater streams is often limited. Recent advancements in remote sensors, data processing capacities, and statistical approaches are bridging past technological barriers to improve simulations of surface water flows. The improved model outputs advance the underlying scientific understanding of hydrology for baseline conditions and allows for scenario development to characterize the magnitude, duration, frequency, and timing of stream drying under shifting climate conditions.
